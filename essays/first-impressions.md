## Hello Javascript
As of now, the only other language I know of is Java, and from what I can tell the basics of Javascript are very similar to Java. However, I do feel that Javascript is more lenient as it doesn’t require type specification. It does give me a lot more freedom in that sense. With that being said, ES6 is something that will take me some time to get used to. Arrow function and destructuring syntax were completely new to me, and they are something that I’m not quite comfortable with using just yet. 

Because I just started learning Javascript, I still don’t know enough for me to decide whether it's good or bad from a software engineering perspective. My limited experience with Javascript only involves the WODs, which are simple to implement. As I continue to use Javascript and gain a better understanding of the language’s advantages and disadvantages, I’ll be able to form more of a solid option of it. 

## Athletic Learning
Similar to Javascript, it’s too early for me to say much about the WODs. Because they’re timed and make up such a large portion of our grade, I was nervous when I first learned that we would have to do one every week. However, after doing a few practice WODs, I found that they weren’t so bad. While I now don’t think that they are stressful, so far these WODs have been on things that I am more or less comfortable with. If I’m met with a problem that I don’t immediately know the solution for, the presence of a foreboding timer will certainly make me more stressed. It’s too early to say for certain if this will be a good learning strategy for me, but I am interested in seeing how I'll improve as the semester progresses.
