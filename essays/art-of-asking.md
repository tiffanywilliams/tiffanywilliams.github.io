## Benefits of a Better Question
One look at Stack Overflow and you can see the sheer amount of questions that are asked on the daily. It is a lot. With so many questions it’s unlikely that all of them would get an answer. However, coming in and presenting the public with a first-class inquiry would certainly help your chances of getting a constructive response. Model questions naturally show the sincerity and effort that are put into them, which are more compelling to prospective respondents than questions that don’t. In fact, as you cultivate your top-notch question, you may come to find the solution on your own. 

What makes a better question better is the research that goes into it, and all that research can be a learning opportunity, which would teach you a lot more than if you were just provided with an answer. Problem-solving is a critical skill in software engineering, so as a software engineer, it would be very beneficial to get into the habit of exhausting your own resources before going to others for help at the first sign of trouble. 


## Inquiries in Action
Questions of all magnitudes can be found in Stack Overflow. From the simple to the complex, they have it all. A prime example of a choice question can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12738056/creating-a-10-band-equalizer-using-web-audio-api). In their forum, the inquirer is asking for help on how to recreate a ‘Winamp’s 10-band equalizer’ using Web Audio API. What makes their question a good one is that the inquirer demonstrated their current knowledge of the subject and specified what was unclear to them. Essentially, their question asks for not a solution to their problem, but for clarification. As a result, all of the replies to the inquiry were constructive and helpful. 

A counterexample could be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12561708/cant-get-code-to-work). Here, the inquirer is asking for help on their JSFiddle, but they don’t give any details on what they are having problems with, or what they expect their code to do. Some people were displeased by this as a few responses to the forum included: “You need to make more of an effort to debug the issue yourself. Then raise a question regarding the issue.” and “poor question subject. not much effort or description except ‘look at my fiddle’”. Despite this, some did come bearing possible solutions.


## Asking Questions: A Skill
Asking good questions isn’t typically considered as a skill, at least it’s not a skill that readily comes to mind, but it is a skill nonetheless. For the best results, time and effort are a must as better inquiries will most likely have more priority. However, in the end, good and bad questions alike can get equally helpful responses.
