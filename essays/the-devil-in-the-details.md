## Devil in the Details
Every language has a standardized pattern and Javascript is no exception. Yes, ESLint may be a bit finicky but their finickiness is for the better. If everyone has their own way of writing Javascript, there would be a definite struggle come time for them to share their code. If one opts to write a few lines of long code–– code that squeezes as much as it can into one line––then the next person to lay eyes on it won’t have a great time reading it. I know that I won't. Having code be readable and easy on the eyes gets so much more important the more lines you have. If the program ends up taking a thousand lines, then having even the minute details like the right spacing or indentation would help make everything more readable. 

In my first week of using ESLint, I found the experience to be pretty okay; it wasn’t entirely good but it also wasn’t entirely bad. In a time crunch, having all of those red marks while trying to figure out why my very-work-in-progress code isn’t working can be a bit distracting. I, myself, am a bit of a messy coder. This is especially true if I’m working under a timer. When I don’t know something, my default is to throw something and see what sticks. The last thing I want to be concerned about is if I have a space between the closing parenthesis of a parameter and the open curly-brace of a function. And yet, I would still find myself trying to fix it the moment I see red despite having bigger fish to fry. Of course, this is to not fault ESLint; it’s doing what it’s meant to do. With that being said, I don’t have any real difficulties with ESLint when I have all the time I need to mess around with my code. Nonetheless, I’m sure that I would have less trouble with ESLint once I get more accustomed to its coding standards.

## Cross Your T's and Dot Your I's
In all, I think ESLint is useful and a very helpful tool to have in your arsenal. It might be a little tedious at first, but the payoff is well worth the initial struggle with those red lines and X’s. In the long-run, it offers you nothing but perks as having good-looking code will make things easier for yourself and for other people. After all, having readable code won’t hold you back, but having messy code will.
