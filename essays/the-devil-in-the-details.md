## Spell Check, but for Javascript
Every language has a standardized pattern and Javascript is no exception. Yes, ESLint may be a bit finicky but their finickiness is for the better. If everyone has their own way of writing Javascript, there would be a definite struggle come time for them to share their code. If one opts to write a few lines of long code–– code that squeezes as much as it can into one line––then the next person to lay eyes on it won’t have a great time reading it. I know that I won't. Having code be readable and easy on the eyes gets so much more important the more lines you have. If the program ends up taking a thousand lines, then having even the minute details like the right spacing or indentation would help make everything more readable. 

In my first week of using ESLint, I found the experience to be pretty okay; it wasn’t entirely good but it also wasn’t entirely bad. In a time crunch, having all of those red marks while trying to figure out why my very-work-in-progress code isn’t working can be a bit distracting. I, myself, am a bit of a messy coder. This is especially true if I’m working under a timer. When I don’t know something, my default is to throw something and see what sticks. The last thing I want to be concerned about is if I have a space between the closing parenthesis of a parameter and the open curly-brace of a function. And yet, I would still find myself trying to fix it the moment I see red. Of course, this is to not fault ESLint; it’s just doing what it’s meant to do. I’m sure that I would have less trouble with ESLint once I get more used to Javascript’s coding standards. 

This actually isn’t my first tango with coding standards. I had to use a style checker in a previous class, but I went about things a little differently back then. I used to turn it off completely and do what I needed to do without any regard for style correctness. I would only turn it on right at the end once I was done writing out my code. Only then would I go back and fix all of the style errors, like indentation, spacing, and whatnot. While that method worked for me, it doesn’t really help me learn how to naturally code in accordance with the coding standard, which is why I’m not going to do it this time around. It’s tempting, but adapting to Javascript’s coding standard is for my own good. 

## Cross Your T's and Dot Your I's
In all, I think ESLint is useful and a very helpful tool to have in your arsenal. It might be a little tedious at first, but the payoff is well worth the initial struggle with those red lines and X’s. In the long-run, it offers you nothing but perks as having good-looking code will make things easier for yourself and for other people. After all, having readable code won’t hold you back, but having messy code will.
