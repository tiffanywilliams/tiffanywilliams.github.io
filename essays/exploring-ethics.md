### Ethics: An Overview

Ethics, specifically Western ethics, dates all the way back to ancient Greece at around 500 BC. Major ancient Greek philosophers, such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, began the study of human nature during the reign of science and astronomy, sparking a newly-found interest in the study of mind, existence, and reality. With the pursuit of philosophy came the study of morality, and from the foundation laid by these philosophers came forth a dynasty of moral thinkers who debated principles of right and wrong to better serve the human condition. 

The field of ethics is a great one, but for the purposes of this essay we’ll be looking at only two schools of thought: Kantism and Utilitarianism. 

Now, Kantian ethics was established by German philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 1700’s. Kantian ethics can be described as very absolute and black-and-white in thinking. For a Kantian, there is no excuse or exception to violate moral rules. For example, to a Kantian, lying is bad no matter what even if that lie was to bring more happiness as an outcome. This school of thought directly opposes the moral theory Utilitarianism, which focuses more on the results of our actions and finds intent irrelevant. This means that regardless of the action, if the outcome is good, then that action is good. In the example mentioned above, an Utilitarianist would say that lying, in that instance, would be good. 

Ethics today, as I see it, requires a little bit of both. While it’s good to stress the importance of the results and impacts of one’s actions, there should also be a certain line which people shouldn’t cross. 

### How Does Ethics Apply to Software Engineering?

Software engineering is a critical component in a lot of modern technology. To best illustrate the importance of software engineering, here’s a passage taken from [What do we mean when we talk about ethics?](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s20/morea/ethics/reading-se-ethics-intro.html):

> How many cars or rockets are made today that do not depend upon critical software for their safe operation? How many bridges are built today without the use of sophisticated computer programs to calculate expected load, geophysical strain, material strength and design resilience?
