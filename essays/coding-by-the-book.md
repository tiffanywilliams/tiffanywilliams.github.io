### Design Patterns: An Instructional

You might have heard a phrase, “cooking by the book.” Well, design patterns are “coding by the book.” Design patterns provide software engineers a general template, or blueprint, that can help them find a solution to common problems in software engineering. To quote Christopher Alexander, an architect and design theorist:

>“Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.”

Though the origins of design patterns lie in architecture, its ideas of defining common problems and providing a groundwork on how to solve them can be extended to any practice under the sun, including but not limited to software engineering. 

We can think of design patterns as a cookbook that’s more of a tips-and-tricks guide for a budding home-cook. This cookbook can provide a guide for solving cooking mishaps. Is the dish too sweet? Don’t worry! You can counteract that with something bitter like, unsweetened cocoa. It doesn’t have to be unsweetened cocoa; anything would work as long as it has some bitterness to downplay the sweetness. Dish too salty? That can be solved by adding some acidity or sweetness to balance the salt. It doesn’t really matter how you do it. What you want to add as the acid or sweetness is up to the cook, but it will still work as long as the guideline is followed. This is similar to how design patterns for software engineering work. There’s a lot of flexibility in how it’s implemented. 


## Experiences With Design Patterns

Until this point, I had no idea what design patterns were. However, because they are so ingrained in the practice of software engineering, they still popped up in my code regardless of my awareness. Now that I’m formally acquainted with a few design patterns, I’m able to recognize instances where I used them in my code. A few that I have used are bbservers and MVC. In my group project, CL-UH-B, I utilized observers through the publisher and subscribers.
