## A Last Minute Decision
I initially enrolled in the University of Hawaii at Manoa as a Biology major with a goal to get into medical school. I had been dead-set on going into the medical field since I started high school. However, that all changed in a single month before I even started my first semester at college. I found myself suddenly in need of a new major when a good friend of mine, who I knew to be wonderfully passionate about coding, suggested that I should try my hand at computer science. And so, I did. 

Admittedly, there’s still a lot that I don’t know about this field in terms of its specialties. Game development and cybersecurity are the two that I noticed the most. I don’t have much experience with the latter, but I did try my hand at making a few simple games in an introductory computer science class. It was fun, however, what I made can only be described as very rudimentary and crude. While game development is a fun practice in itself, I find its ability to create a compelling and interactive story its most compelling aspect. 

## Moving forward
There’s a lot I wish to learn and do before I graduate. With so many fields of interest within computer science, I want to take it upon myself to try a little bit of everything: AI, data science, cybersecurity, game development, etc.. I want to use my time as an undergraduate to acquaint myself with as many specialties as I can so that I have a bigger pool to choose from when deciding my profession later in the future. I also want to start doing more computer-science-related projects and maybe get an internship next summer.
