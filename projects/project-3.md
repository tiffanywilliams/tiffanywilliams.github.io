Wizarding World is a game that I helped make in ‘Introduction to Computer Science I’. The purpose of the project was to collaborate in a group to create a program that reflected what we had learned in the class. My team decided to do a game based on ‘Harry Potter’. The game we made had two stages. In the first stage, Harry has to collect five amulets while avoiding incoming enemies. After collecting five amulets, the final battle stage is commenced. In the final battle stage, Harry has to avoid Voldemort’s attacks and hit Voldemort with his own. The game is won when Harry defeats Voldemort. 

In this project, I was responsible for the final stage. I created and implemented Voldemort’s attack patterns which involve three different attacks that are done at random, implemented Harry’s attacks, and made sure that the hits were registered. 

The project helped to hone my skills in object-oriented programming and Java. The experience also showed me how crucial communication is when working in a group, especially when it relates to computer science.
