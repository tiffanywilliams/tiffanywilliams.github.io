The Spring Piano Recital was an event I attended and played in while at Kalani, 2018. It was held at the Orvis Auditorium. We had a couple of months to prepare for the recital and spent most of our class time practicing for it. I also spent time outside of class to practice since I did have a longer piece. While we had an instructor to help us, it was mostly independent practice. 

My performance certainly wasn’t perfect. I definitely had very noticeable slip-ups, but that’s okay because the experience taught me how to accept mistakes and recover from them.
