The Spring Piano Recital was an event I attended and played in while at Kalani, 2018. It was held in the Orvis Auditorium at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The piece I played was 'Mariage D'amour'composed by Paul de Senneville. We, the class, were given a few months to prepare for the recital. 

Performing in the recital taught me how to accept mistakes and recover from them. My performance was in no means perfect. With each mistake, I felt more and more anxious but I continued to play despite of that. Although I spent months practicing my piece, once I was up on the stage, started to blank out and fumble at places where I was usually okay with. Through this experience, I really got to see how important confidence is. Skill and preperation is important, but if there's no confidence in the delivery then you won't be able to play at your full capacity. This can ring true to things beyong musical performances.
