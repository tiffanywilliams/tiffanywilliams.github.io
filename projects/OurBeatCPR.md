OurBeat CPR was a semester project where students of Kalani’s Health Academy would organize an event at an elementary or middle school to teach the kids what to do if they witness someone going into cardiac arrest. The children are taught how to recognize cardiac arrest, how to give chest compressions, and how to use an AED. Everything from school release forms to transportation is all handled by the Health Academy students, with the supervision of the instructor. 

For OurBeat CPR, I collaborated with two other students and together we organized and oversaw the OurBeat event at Waiʻalae Elementary Public Charter School. I handled everything that regarded the school administration. This includes obtaining permission, filling out the necessary forms, and finding someone to supervise the event. I also created an outline for the event and organized team meetings. 

This experience taught me how to be an adaptive leader. While it's important to be organized and prepared, it’s impossible to be prepared for everything. For such reasons, being adaptable and quick-thinking are skills that are just as important when in any position.
