E-Impact is a web application aimed to address the pressing issue of climate change by focusing on vehicle usage and fossil fuel consumption. By showcasing personal and community impacts, the application encourages users to adopt more sustainable practices in their daily lives.

The primary objective of E-Impact is to inspire awareness and action regarding greenhouse gas emissions. By allowing users to track their personal and community-level impacts, the application provides valuable insights into individual contributions to climate change. Users can visualize their data through graphs and charts on their dashboard, helping them understand the significance of their actions.
