[RNDVOUS](https://rndvouz.github.io/) is a a transformative mobile app designed to combat the environmental impact of fast fashion by fostering a community of conscious consumers. With RNDVOUS, one can effortlessly exchange and trade clothing with just a swipe, making sustainable fashion fun and accessible for everyone. RNDVOUS's mission is simple: “Helping sustainable clothing, one swipe at a time.” 

I collaborated with three other students—[Tracy Bui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracy-bui-30553621b/), [Yick Ching (Jeff) Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-yc-wong/), and [Feimei Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/feimei-chen-4b1206204/). I came up with the concept of combining swiping with clothes swaps. I also made significant contributions to the backend database integration. Tracy led the UI design, Jeff focused on backend architecture, and Feimei developed messaging and notification features.

Through the development of RNDVOUS, I enhanced my skills in using Flutter, a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications, and Dart, the programming language behind Flutter. I also gained experience with Firebase--a platform that provides backend services such as real-time databases and authentication--, Riverpod--a state management library that simplifies handling app states--, and Freezed--a package that helps create immutable data classes with ease.
